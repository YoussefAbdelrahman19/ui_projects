This small Vue app shows a simple update of state with vuex for SVG animations. Animations work both in the `<transition>` component, and also within `mounted()`, for more complex movement. I'm using GreenSock Animation API, and splitting the defs into their own template file.

## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build
```
